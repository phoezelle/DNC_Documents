This folder contains scripts developped by Dan for using a Raspberry Pi (raspi) to interface with the OpenSprinkler controller. The files mainly consist of two parts 1) storing and serving Javascripts required by OpenSprinkler on a raspi server, and 2) using the raspi to log OpenSprinkler status (this part is based on Dave Gustavson's PHP scripts). As raspi is compact, low-cost, and low-power, it has become an increasingly popular platform for running embedded linux. This makes it suitable for running http server, scripts, and interface with home automation devices. 

Note that part 1 (serving Javascripts on raspi) is optional: the default OpenSprinkler firmware points to Javascripts stored on the Rayshobby server (http://rayshobby.net). 

Detailed instructions can be found in the file 'Raspberry Pi for OpenSprinkler.html' or online at:
