====== Update ======
* Mar 25, 2012:
  - changed code to use the OpenSprinkler Arduino library
  - support for an arbitrary number of extension boards
  - moved book-keeping data (i.e. each station's stop time and scheduled time) to EEPROM to free up SRAM space.
  - added 'reset all' button to close all stations at once

====== Description ======
This is a simple button-based web control interface. Each station can be toggled individually using a button (or directly through http command). You can set the duration for each station. The program keeps track of the running time and stops a station when the duration is reached. The duration is set with the number of hours and minutes. Leaving them to 0 means the duration is indefinite (i.e. once on, the stations will remain open until you click on 'Turn it Off').

For direct http access, follow this example:

http://192.168.1.22/set?b=5&v=1&h=1&m=30

- b is the station index (starts from 0)
- v is the bit value (0 for closing and 1 for opening)
- h is the number of hours
- m is the number of minutes

In the above example, station 6 will open for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
As an another example:

http://192.168.1.22/set?b=5&v=1

will open station 6 until it's closed using http://192.168.1.22/set?b=5&v=0
Finally, use

http://192.168.1.22/reset

to reset all stations at once.

====== How to use the code ======
The code is tested in Arduino-0022 and 0023. It's not guaranteed to work with other versions of Arduino. The code requires the 'OpenSprinkler' library, which you should copy (or put a symbolic link) in the Arduino's 'libraries' directory. To compile, open svc_button_ctrl.pde in Arduino IDE and click on 'compile'.
