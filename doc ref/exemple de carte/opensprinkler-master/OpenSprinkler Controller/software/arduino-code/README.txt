Compilation Instructions

NOTE:
====
The recommended method for compiling the current firmware is now through a virtual Linux OS. The virtual Linux has all the necessary software and settings pre-installed. All you need to do is to download the free VirtualBox software and use the virtual Linux image file by following the instructions here: http://rayshobby.net/?p=6149.

The default sudo user of the virtual Linux is opensprinkler and the password is the same as the user name.
